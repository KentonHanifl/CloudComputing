# CloudComputing
## Installation:
Please note this is really not ready to be installed yet but this is what needs to be done:  
* Get the credentials for Google Drive and Dropbox from me (not sure how to generate them per user yet)
* Fork the project and download it
* Make two directories in the directory you saved it in called "gdrive" and "dropbox"
* Make a .txt file called "userAccounts" in the directory with the only text in the file being: 0\n0 (\n denotes the newline character)
* Run DiaggStorageUI.pyw and you should be good to go.
